# spark-shell
  behind the scenes, spark-shell invokes the more general spark-submit script
  options:
    spark-shell --help
    --master: set which master the context connects to
      ex. --master yarn: run Spark on a Hadoop YARN cluster (YARN: the resource manager in Hadoop2)
      ex. --master local: run Spark locally with one worker thread (i.e. no parallelism at all)
      ex. --master local[K]: run Spark locally with K worker threads (set this to the number of cores on your machine)
    --packages: add dependencies (ex. Spark Packages) to shell session by supplying a comma-separated list of maven coordinates to the argument
    --repositories: additional repositories where dependencies might exist (ex. Sonatype)
    --jars: a list of libraries to be distributed to executors
            the application jar along with any jars included with the --jars option will be automatically transferred to the cluster
            URLs supplied after --jars must be separated by commas

# spark-submit
  submit an application
  syntax:
    $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --class <main-class> \
    --master <master-url> \
    --deploy-mode <deploy-mode> \
    --conf <key>=<value> \
    <application-jar> [application-arguments]
  options:
    --class: the entry point for your application (ex. org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi)
    --master: the master URL for the cluster (ex. spark://23.195.26.187:7077)
    --deploy-mode: deploy your driver on the worker nodes (cluster) or locally as an external client (default: client)
      cluster mode: launches the driver inside of the cluster
      client mode: submitter launches the driver outside of the cluster
    --conf: arbitrary Spark configuration property in key=value format
    <application-jar>: path to a bundled jar including your application and all dependencies
                 the URL must be globally visible inside of your cluster
                 ex. hdfs://[path] or a file://[path] that is present on all nodes
    [application-arguments]: arguments passed to the main method of main class
