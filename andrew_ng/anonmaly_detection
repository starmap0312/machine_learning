# anomalous examples
  ex1. detect anomalous aircraft engines
       given aircraft engine features: heat generated, vibration intensity, etc.
       predict if an engine is anomalous (NOT normal)
  ex2. detect anomalous website users (ex. bot users)
  ex3. monitor anomalous computers in a data center

# Gaussian distribution (i.e. Normal distribution)
  mean
  variance (suare of stardard deviation)

# anomaly detection algorithm
  1) choose features that you think are indicatives of anomalous examples
     an example is anomalous if these feature values are rare
  2) estimate the parameters means and variances of these features
  3) predict an example is anomalous if the probability of its feature values is less than a threshold (epsilon) 

# choice of threshold
  use cross-validation set to decide the threshold based on f-score (precision and recall)

# anomaly detection vs. supervised learning
  1) anaomaly detection: very small number of positive examples
     ex. fraud detection, manufacturing error, monitoring problematic machine in a data center, etc.
     not suitable for supervised learning, as future anomalous examples may have patterns not seen yet
  2) supervised learning: large number of positive and negative examples
     ex. email spam classification, weather prediction (sunny/rainy), cancer classification, etc.

# choosing features
  1) plot the data to see if a feature resembles to Gaussian distribution
  2) for non-Gaussian features:
     if the data is skewed to one end, then try to take a log to see if it is more like Gaussian distribution
     feed the transformed feature values to anaomaly detection algorithm instead
  3) anomalous example should have rare probability for the feature value (its probablity is neutral, not rare)
     if so, examine the mislabled example and try to create new features to distinguish it from normal examples
     i.e. choosing features that are unusually large or small for anomalous exmaples
