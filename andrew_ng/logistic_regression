# logistic regression
  a classification algorithm
  decision boundary: splits the data into different classes (negative/positive: 0/1)
  it predicts a probability (chance that an example is positive)
  logistic regression is not good for non-linear classification
    for non-linear classification, use neural networks or support vector machines

# classification problem
  the values we want to predict belongs to a small number of discrete values
    ex. binary classification problem: 0/1

# multi-class classification
  if you have multiple classes, use one-vs-all classification (one-vs-rest)
  ex. if we have three classes: Class 1, 2, 3, then
      train a logistic regression classifier for each of the classes
        i.e train for Class 1 vs. Class 2,3, and Class 2 vs. Class 1,3, and Class 3 vs. Class 1, 2
      then pick the maximum prediction (probability) as the final prediction

# sigmoid function (used in hypothesis)
  a probability/percentage (between 0 and 1) that an example is positive
    sigmoid(0) = 0.5 ... sigmoid(+x) > 0.5 and sigmoid(-x) < 0.5
  it smooths out the predictions, instead of a prediction of just negative/positive (0/1)

# cost function
  how far the predicted probability is away from its answer
  we do not use the square error function as the cost function would be non-convex (i.e. wavy, many local optima)
    becuase the hypothesis uses a sigmoid function, which is not linear
  instead, the cost function takes a log scale, so that it is convex
    the more wrong you were, the more you get penalized
      for a positive example:
        cost -> 0    when prediction -> 1
        cost -> inf  when prediction -> 0
      the penality grows exponentially if the prediction is close to 0 for a positive example

# optimazation algorithm
  to find optimal parameters, we need to:
    compute the cost function for a given parameters (checking the convergence) and
    compute the derivative for each parameter terms
  we can rely on one of the following optimazation algorithms:
  (need to pick a learning rate)
  1) gradient descent
     note that the update of parameters in logistic regression are identical to the update in linear regression
     the only difference is that logistic regression uses a sigmoid function in the hypothesis 
  (no need to pick a learning rate, faster ways than gradient descent, but more complex) 
  2) conjugate gradient
  3) BFGS
  4) L-BFGS
