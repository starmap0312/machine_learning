# linear regression
  used to predict a value (ex. predict the price of a house based on its size)
  1) hypothesis: predictions for any given feature (feature x -> prediction y)
  2) parameters: parameters of terms in a hypothesis 
  3) cost function: errors against the data for any given hypothesis (a higher-order function parameterized for all hypotheses)
  4) objective/goal: find the optimal parameters with the minimum error

# the cost function
  how far the predictions are away from the actual data (how good your line fits the data)
  a way of measuring how well any given hypothesis fits into the data
  ex. square error function, or mean squared error (most commonly used cost function for linear regression, a convex function, bowl-shaped)

# gradient descent
  parameter learning: used to find the optimal parameters (the best line that fits the data)
  1) learning rate: step size when descending (it affects when the convergence will happen)
  2) derivative:
